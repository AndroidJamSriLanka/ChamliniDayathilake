My project idea

Gift suggetion app

It is an android mobile application that gives help you for gift selection. 
Here you just have to enter the age group, gender, your budget, personality, relationship and the event of the receiver and the app will give you the most suitable suggetions to make it great.
After user inserted the information it will sort out the pre-entered gift list and give the user a list of them to make the better choice.
This also provides the places that you can buy those products in your area and give the directions if the user wants.
The app will provide aseparate interface for the gift shop owners thier products' details.

I have modified my app idea a little bit.
As I said earlier, it is an app for gift suggession for some given inputs.
The user is required to enter gender, age group and relationship and the budget he/she is willing to spend.
According to these inputs, some gift categories will be suggested and when the user selected some category, the details of products from ebay, the user can purchase will be suggested to the user.

I am using two data sources for my app.
One is a local database for gift category suggessions and ebay for product suggetions.

I have uploaded my initial UI designs.
